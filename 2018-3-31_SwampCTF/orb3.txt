I made this challenge.  More details in the official repo.

This was a challenge intended to teach the command mogrify.
You are presented with a bit of a story saying that reality will fracture
after a powerful spell is cast and it's your job to put back the pieces.
You'll see a folder with ~10k folders many of which contain a 10x10 image.
Your job is to reconstruct this image.
You can do this by:
 1) moving all images to the root directory : mv */* .
 2) mogrify ... I'll let you do the rest
The image is a neat find from the ffxv wiki called Crystal Tower.
The flag is a quote from marvel's hydra.

A lot of the lore is straight from Forgotten Realms wiki.
 Additionally, there are references to Stranger Things and Wheel of Time.

I wrote the orb series.

Orb 1 was a substitution cipher written without the letter e and z.
This makes it a lipogram.
It made it a tad harder on the automated solvers, but it was also a hint.
Many people decrypted the message and were wondering where the flag could hide.
The flag was in the translation from plain text to cipher text.

I generated the problem with the following command:
cat secret.txt | tr a-z "flag{secretflag}" > encrypted.txt

Similarly, one could experiment with the reverse command:
cat encrypted.txt | tr "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" a-z | less

Using some online solver like quipqiup gets one most of the way.
We might then realize that each time we see an f in the cipher text it corresponds
to an a in the plain text denoted as f->a. We'll replace it in the command as follows:

cat encrypted.txt | tr "fbcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" a-z | less

Similar in this way we'll make guesses, gradually narrowing down and revealing
the flag with successive views of the best guess so far.
